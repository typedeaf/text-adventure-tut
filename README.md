Overview
-------
This project was developed as a response to the large number of beginning Python developer who want to learn how to write a text adventure.

Although there are many approaches, this project is designed to be expandable with "pluggable" elements.

Tutorial

For an in-depth tutorial, please see [How to Write a Text Adventure in Python](http://letstalkdata.com/2014/08/how-to-write-a-text-adventure-in-python/).

Typedeaf Fork
--------
The major changes made to this for are as follows:
- Ported to Python 2.x
- Gold now accumulates its amount when picked up
- Rooms do not respawn their loot
- New action to view a map of the dungeon
- Dungeon map.txt resource is in a different format that is easier (for me) to work with in text editors than the tab based original
